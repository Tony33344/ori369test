It helps endurance athletes improve performance faster and push their VO2 max beyond what training alone can achieve.Formulated with high-potency adaptogens and beta-alanine, Absolute improves oxygen efficiency, enhances blood flow, and reduces muscle acidity — all essential for boosting endurance and performance.Why adaptogens? They function in several ways. Their most important effect is to reduce sport-related stress, a common issue during endurance exercise. As stress levels rise, adaptogens help regulate them, ensuring your body’s cardiovascular system functions efficiently.
