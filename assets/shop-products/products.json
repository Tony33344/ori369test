    "description_text": "Cardio Max is a natural product to support the most important muscle in your body — your heart. Supports the heart muscle Supports the nervous system Increases oxygen flow Product Description Cardio Max 4Endurance Pro provides everything your body needs for optimal cardiovascular and nervous system function in one product. The product is based on the coenzyme Q10, quercetin, and other high-quality ingredients to support your heart muscle and the nervous system. High Absorption Rate The problem with most similar supplements on the market is that they have poor absorption rates because they do not contain the crucial ingredient to improve absorption — an ionophore. An ionophore is a compound that helps micronutrients penetrate the cell and prevent viruses and free radicals from multiplying. In Cardio Max, the ionophore function is performed by quercetin. Micronutrients Each Cardio Max capsule contains all the essential high-quality micronutrients to aid your normal cardio function. This makes the product even more well-rounded and purposeful! Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress! Selenium protects cells from oxidative stress, supports the thyroid gland function, and contributes to normal immune function. Vitamin B1 or thiamine contributes to the normal functioning of the nervous system and the normal functioning of the heart muscle. Intense training puts your body under constant physical stress, so the optimal function of your cardiovascular and nervous systems is crucial for you. Product Benefits Supports the heart muscle Supports the nervous system Increases oxygen flow Protects cells from oxidative stress Boosts the immune system Reduces fatigue Recommended use Take 1 capsule daily with water, preferably in the morning after a meal .

Boosts testosterone levels Improves recovery and performance Boosts ATP energy levels Product Description Alpha Boost 4Endurance Pro is a natural testosterone booster that increases the levels of this important hormone, leading to better recovery, higher energy levels, increased muscle mass, and improved male libido. Alpha Boost contains crucial minerals, amino acids, and the full support of carefully selected adaptogens — no fillers, no cheap ingredients, only the best ingredients in optimal doses. Amino acids Alpha Boost contains L-Ornithine and Asparatic Acid (DAA). L-Ornithine has several roles including supporting strength, endurance, and muscle recovery, reducing stress levels, and promoting better sleep. DAA can improve testosterone levels, especially in inactive individuals and those with lower levels of this hormone. Adaptogens Adaptogens increase your body's ability to manage stress caused by exercise. Consequently, your body is better suited for efforts, has more strength, recovers faster, and is generally better prepared for intense exercise. Some adaptogens increase the body's natural testosterone production and reduce the stress hormone cortisol. Alpha Boost contains only the best and carefully selected adaptogens to help the body cope with stress and begin to function optimally. Ashwagandha reduces stress and benefits cognitive functions, VO2 max, psychophysical well-being, and energy levels. Ashwagandha can also achieve an average increase in testosterone of about 15% and an 18% increase in DHEA (a hormone that helps produce other hormones, including testosterone) in men over 40. Fenusterols Fenugreek in patented and proven 600 mg dosages with saponins has substantial anabolic and androgenic effects, influencing testosterone levels and muscle performance. Fenugreek with creatine supplementation also improves creatine uptake without requiring a high carbohydrate intake. Suma Root is an adaptogen with a long history of use. The root (active ingredient) increases energy levels and reduces stress and tension. It is also believed that the root is a potent aphrodisiac. Black Maca is a natural aphrodisiac that may boost your libido. Red Ginseng is an adaptogen that increases alertness and life energy and reduces exercise-induced stress. In sports, ginseng increases oxygen flow, endurance, and focus. Cordyceps Sinesis reduces fatigue and improves oxygen utilization during exercise. Ginseng improves your alertness, increases energy levels, and helps your body to combat stress. Minerals Alpha Boost contains all the essential male minerals : zinc citrate, boron, and selenium. Zinc supports healthy testosterone levels, fertility, immune system, and protein synthesis. Boron supports healthy testosterone levels and with Selenium contributes to normal spermatogenesis and cell protection. Shilajit Shilajit is a sediment of plants and rocks that contains more than eighty-five minerals and trace elements the human body needs for optimal functioning. It is also the only mineral with adaptogenic properties beneficial to men's well-being. Support healthy testosterone levels and athletic performance with this advanced blend of amino acids, minerals, high-quality adaptogens, and Shijalit.

It affects your memory, concentration and well-being, and prevents you from hitting a \"wall\" or running out of energy later on. It also allows you to have normal coordination and balance, which is especially important for athletes. Vitamin B Complex allows you to stay focused even during long and strenuous workouts when stress hormones and inflammatory factors are particularly high. This includes vitamin B6, which plays a key role in the mental and general well-being of the athlete, and vitamin B12, which gives the body the energy it needs. Inositol and PABA are important signalling substances involved in various biochemical processes. These include the regulation of blood sugar and the normalization of hormonal balance. Vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin that your body needs but cannot produce on its own. It supports the normal functioning of nerve cells and is necessary for the production of red blood cells. Vegetarians and vegans are particularly deficient in it, as they cannot get it into their bodies through natural foods. Products Benefits Increases energy levels Improves stress response Reduces fatigue Improves psychophysical well-being Ensures normal energy conversion Important link in DNA synthesis With PABA and Inositol Recommened Use Take one capsule per day, ideally between meals in the first half of the day.

    "description_text": "High-carb sports drink containing 90 grams of carbohydrates and an advanced electrolyte mix per serving that is easy on the stomach. ✔ Max carbohydrate dose in a single serving ✔ Preserves glycogen stores ✔ Sustains optimal hydration ✔ Prevents muscle cramps ✔ No digestive issues Product Description Nrgy Drink 90 is designed for high-performance athletes who fuel at 90 g of carbs or more per hour and want to do it efficiently — with less fluid and zero digestive issues . Each serving delivers 90 grams of carbohydrates in just 1 bottle using the scientifically proven 1:0.8 glucose to fructose ratio and contains the Nduranz Electrolyte Mix that replicates exactly what you lose through sweat. It’s the most effective way to hit your fueling targets with just 500 ml of water without being too sweet or upsetting your stomach. Ideal for races, cooler conditions, and any situation where drinking more simply isn’t an option. CARBOHYDRATE RATIO Nrgy Drink 90 is based on the Nduranz Carbohydrate Ratio , a 1:0.8 ratio between glucose (maltodextrin) and fructose. It is scientifically proven to be the optimal ratio, which allows the highest absorption of 90 grams of carbohydrates per hour without burdening your digestive system and causing digestive issues . ELECTROLYTE MIX Nrgy Drink 90 contains the Nduranz Electrolyte Mix , an advanced mix of minerals that matches the electrolytes you lose with sweat. This mix enables optimal hydration during intense exercise without causing digestive issues , which are a common downside of many electrolyte formulas. COMBINING WITH OTHER FUELING PRODUCTS For best results, combine Nrgy Drink 90 with other Nduranz fueling products. They all use the same carbohydrate ratio , and those that include electrolytes share the same Nduranz Electrolyte Mix — minimizing digestive issues. Nrgy Drink 90 delivers max energy intake with minimal fluid! Designed for races and extreme endurance challenges. Nrgy Drink 45 vs. Nrgy Drink 90 Nrgy Drink 90 is a sports drink adapted for higher energy intake. Although it offers the same amount of CHO per scoop (22.5 g) as Nrgy Drink, the amount of electrolytes and the strength of the taste are adapted to the higher amount in a single bottle. This way, Nrgy Drink 90 ensures that you get just the right amount of electrolytes in one serving (4 scoops) and a suitably strong taste. If you were to mix 2 portions of Nrgy Drink 45 (4 scoops) in a bottle, you would have double the amount of electrolytes in one bottle and a drink with an extremely strong taste. The former, in particular, opens up the possibility of digestive problems. Nrgy Drink 90 also allows you to intake more CHO with less fluid, as you can intake 90 grams with just 500 ml of water. Nrgy Drink requires 1000 ml of water for an intake of 90 grams. Product Benefits Max carbohydrate dose in a single serving Preserves glycogen stores Sustains optimal hydration Prevents muscle cramps No digestive issues More energy with less fluid Simplifies fueling No artificial sweeteners Recommended Use Consume 1 serving per hour of intense exercise. For one serving, mix 4 scoops with 500 ml of water and drink during exercise. TIP: In hot conditions, you can use 750 ml of water. Use the Nduranz Fuel Calculator to easily estimate your required energy intake during exercise.
